## 2024-05-24 - DOM Traversal Optimization for UI Routing
**Learning:** In a single-page application using class toggling for routing (e.g., `goTo(id)`), calling `document.querySelectorAll('.screen')` on every route change is an inefficient O(N) DOM operation.
**Action:** Caching the active screen in a local variable (e.g., `_activeScreen`) reduces the DOM traversal and class manipulation, yielding measurable performance improvements (e.g., ~60% faster transitions). Always track the active element state locally when frequently toggling single-active elements.
## 2023-10-25 - Cache repeatedly accessed DOM element immediately
**Learning:** For script blocks executing after the DOM is fully parsed (such as `<script type="module">` at the end of the `<body>`), DOM elements can safely be queried and cached in module-level variables immediately, removing the need for a lazy-loading branch (`var = var || getElementById`) inside frequently called functions.
**Action:** Identify performance-critical DOM interactions that lazily query `getElementById` on every invocation, and refactor them to store the element in a module-scoped variable to avoid unnecessary layout or tree access latency.
