## 2026-08-04 - Screen Reader Support for Transparent Hitzone UI
**Learning:** The application implements interactive elements (buttons and inputs) as transparent 'hitzone' overlays over background images. Since these `<button>` elements contain no text or icons, they are completely invisible to screen readers, causing a severe accessibility issue where users don't know what the buttons do.
**Action:** Always ensure transparent hitzone elements have explicit `aria-label` attributes assigned to describe their function (e.g., `aria-label="Sign In"`).

## 2026-08-05 - Keyboard Accessibility for Transparent Hitzone UI
**Learning:** The application implements interactive elements (buttons and inputs) as transparent 'hitzone' overlays over background images. These elements lack default focus indicators, making it impossible for keyboard users (like those using Tab to navigate) to know which element is currently focused.
**Action:** Always ensure transparent hitzone elements have explicit `:focus-visible` styles (e.g., `outline: 2px solid #c9a15a`) to provide visual feedback for keyboard navigation without affecting mouse clicks.

## 2024-05-18 - Enter-to-Submit Accessibility
**Learning:** Custom transparent input overlays often lack form wrapping, meaning users cannot hit 'Enter' to submit, breaking standard keyboard UX.
**Action:** Always add onkeydown listeners to inputs or wrap them in semantic form tags when building custom transparent hitzones.
## 2024-05-15 - ARIA live regions for dynamic overlays
**Learning:** JS-driven overlays (loaders and toast messages) that conditionally appear need aria-live and roles (status/alert) to ensure screen readers announce them properly.
**Action:** Always add role="alert" and aria-live="assertive" to temporary message boxes, and role="status" aria-live="polite" to loading indicators in index.html and other web views.
