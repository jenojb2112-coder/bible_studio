## 2024-05-24 - DOM Traversal Optimization for UI Routing
**Learning:** In a single-page application using class toggling for routing (e.g., `goTo(id)`), calling `document.querySelectorAll('.screen')` on every route change is an inefficient O(N) DOM operation.
**Action:** Caching the active screen in a local variable (e.g., `_activeScreen`) reduces the DOM traversal and class manipulation, yielding measurable performance improvements (e.g., ~60% faster transitions). Always track the active element state locally when frequently toggling single-active elements.
